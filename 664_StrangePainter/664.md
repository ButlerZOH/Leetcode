## 664、Strange Printer

There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

​		The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
​		At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any places, and will cover the original existing characters.
Given a string consists of lower English letters only, your job is to count the minimum number of turns the printer needed in order to print it.

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.
```



```xml
想法：
刚开始先打印最左边的，之后的从开始的右边开始
dp[l,r] = dp[l+1,r]+1//已经把dp[0,l]都打印好了
如果i能打印到k，那么它一定可以打印到k-1，右边同理(当左边的和k一样时,s[l]=s[k])
dp[l,k] = dp[l,k-1]+dp[k+1,r]
```
